## about

How will artificial intelligence and large language models shape the future of clinical psychology? How do psychological processes like depression and anxiety show up in human language? What is the underlying structure of psychopathology? I use computational linguistics and machine learning to address these questions. 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Stanford [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) working in the [Computational Psychology and Well-Being](https://cpwb.stanford.edu/) and [Fidelity, Adaptation, Sustainability, and Training](https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab.html) labs. I did my PhD in Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Boundaries of Anxiety and Depression lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/ruscio-lab/). I'm part of the [World Well-Being Project](https://wwbp.org/about.html). My research has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I use [evidence-based therapies](https://div12.org/treatments/), including CBT for depression and insomnia, exposure therapy for the anxiety disorders, and cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure for PTSD.

## research

#### ai + mental health
I am currently working on projects using artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) to improve assessment and treatment of psychopathology. Current projects include an AI-based homework helper for an evidence-based treatment for PTSD (with the goal of making therapy homework better), and using LLMs to unpack and measure what happens during psychotherapy (with the goal of making it easier to train therapists in gold-standard treatments). 

#### language + psychopathology
I have also used natural language processing to characterize and measure (and disentangle!) [depression and anxiety](https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000850) and [repetitive negative thinking](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2023.104307). Some of my current work investigates what drives the relationship between depression and first-person singular pronoun use (e.g., I, me, mine).

#### reconsidering psychopathology classification 
Depression and anxiety are not categorical (they are *dimensional* -- severity matters) and cut across traditional diagnostic classes (they are *transdiagnostic*). The prevailing classification system, *DSM-5*, is neither transdiagnostic nor dimensional. This is a problem! [My work](https://psyarxiv.com/vkbnh) has developed and tested a transdiagnostic, dimensional anxiety classification system as a possible alternative. 

#### more
Beyond these research streams, I'm interested in developing behavioral measures of psychological constructs, like [using a joystick to measure characteristics of thought](https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211038017). I also use empirical methods to disentangle or understand the overlap between closely related psychological constructs, like [worry and rumination](https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026221131309).
