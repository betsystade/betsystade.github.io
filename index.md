## about

How can artificial intelligence and large language models help more people get science-backed treatments for mental disorders? How do psychological processes like depression and anxiety show up in human language? I use large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning to address these questions. 

I am a computational clinical psychologist and postdoc at the Stanford [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) working in the [Computational Psychology and Well-Being](https://cpwb.stanford.edu/) and [Fidelity, Adaptation, Sustainability, and Training](https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab.html) labs. I did my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Boundaries of Anxiety and Depression lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/ruscio-lab/). I'm part of the [World Well-Being Project](https://www.wwbp.org/). My research has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am trained in [evidence-based therapies](https://div12.org/treatments/), including CBT for depression and insomnia, exposure therapy for the anxiety disorders, exposure and response prevention for OCD, and cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure for PTSD.

## safe and responsible ai for mental health 

I write about the future of AI and mental heath, including how large language models can [improve research and treatment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-024-00056-z.pdf), what needs to happen [to do this effectively](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/tjv8p), and how we will know when these applications are [ready to deploy](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8zqhw).

## ai mental health tools

I also develop products that use large language models to improve assessment and treatment of psychopathology. Collaborators and I are building an AI-based CBT homework helper and an AI-based platform for training therapists in gold-standard treatments:

## language + psychopathology

I have also used natural language processing to characterize and measure (and disentangle!) [depression and anxiety](https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000850) and [repetitive negative thinking](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2023.104307). Some of my current work investigates what drives the relationship between depression and first-person singular pronoun use (e.g., I, me, mine).

## cognitive and behavioral processes

Beyond these research streams,  I also use empirical methods to study cognitive and behavioral processes, like worry, rumination, perseverative thinking, and behavioral anxiety.

**Stade, E. C.**, & Ruscio, A. M. (2022). [A meta-analysis of the relationship between worry and rumination.](https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026221131309) *Clinical Psychological Science.*

**Stade, E. C.**, Cohen, R., Loftus, P., & Ruscio, A. M. (2022). [A novel measure of real-time perseverative thought.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21677026211038017) *Clinical Psychological Science.* 10(3), 534–552.


## reconsidering psychopathology classification 

Depression and anxiety are not categorical (they are *dimensional* -- severity matters) and cut across traditional diagnostic classes (they are *transdiagnostic*). The prevailing classification system, *DSM-5*, is neither transdiagnostic nor dimensional. This is a problem! We developed and tested a transdiagnostic, dimensional anxiety classification system as an alternative.
