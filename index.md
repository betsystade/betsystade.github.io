## about

How can artificial intelligence and large language models help more people get science-backed treatments for mental disorders? How do psychological processes like depression and anxiety show up in human language? What is the underlying structure of psychopathology? I use computational linguistics and machine learning to address these questions. 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Stanford [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) working in the [Computational Psychology and Well-Being](https://cpwb.stanford.edu/) and [Fidelity, Adaptation, Sustainability, and Training](https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab.html) labs. I did my PhD in Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Boundaries of Anxiety and Depression lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/ruscio-lab/). I'm part of the [World Well-Being Project](https://wwbp.org/about.html). My research has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I use [evidence-based therapies](https://div12.org/treatments/), including CBT for depression and insomnia, exposure therapy for the anxiety disorders, and cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure for PTSD.

## research

#### safe and responsible ai for mental health 
I write about the future of AI and mental heath, including how large language models can [improve research and treatment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-024-00056-z.pdf), what needs to happen [to do this effectively](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/tjv8p), and how we will know when these applications are [ready to deploy](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8zqhw).


#### ai mental health tools
I also develop products that use large language models to improve assessment and treatment of psychopathology. Right now I'm building an AI-based CBT homework helper that aims to make therapy homework better for patients, and an AI-based platform to [help therapists learn](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/wx93m) gold-standard treatments.


#### language + psychopathology
I have also used natural language processing to characterize and measure (and disentangle!) [depression and anxiety](https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000850) and [repetitive negative thinking](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2023.104307). Some of my current work investigates what drives the relationship between depression and first-person singular pronoun use (e.g., I, me, mine).

#### reconsidering psychopathology classification 
Depression and anxiety are not categorical (they are *dimensional* -- severity matters) and cut across traditional diagnostic classes (they are *transdiagnostic*). The prevailing classification system, *DSM-5*, is neither transdiagnostic nor dimensional. This is a problem! [My work](https://psyarxiv.com/vkbnh) has developed and tested a transdiagnostic, dimensional anxiety classification system as a possible alternative. 

#### more
Beyond these research streams, I'm interested in developing behavioral measures of psychological constructs, like [using a joystick to measure characteristics of thought](https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211038017). I also use empirical methods to disentangle or understand the overlap between closely related psychological constructs, like [worry and rumination](https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026221131309).
